            //for example, 
            int[] myInts = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
            //now you can play around with the data in myInts all you like.
            //you can use that syntax with any data type to create an array of data of that type
            //and you can use this syntax if you dont already know what to put in the array
            int[] myInts2 = new int[4]; 
            //this created a list which can store 4 elements

            //at the high school level, you  should probably only be using arrays and other list structures if you feel very confident in all the other basics
            //once you are at that point, I recommend asking Mr V about csCircles, as pythonic lists are much more forgiving and easier to learn than C# ones.
            //Good luck!
